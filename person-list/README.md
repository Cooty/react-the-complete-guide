# People list React demo-app

A simple React.js based demo application that displays a dynamic list of people, with a form.
Based on an assignment from [React - The Complete Guide course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

- Scaffolded with [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
- Uses [React Material UI](https://mui.com/) library for styling.

## TODO:

- [ ] Add E2E tests
- [ ] Add unit-tests
- [ ] Add linting
- [ ] Add deployment pipeline with quality gates (should be impossible to deploy if linting or tests fail)
