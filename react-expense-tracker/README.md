# React Expense tracker app

Simple expense tracker app built with React. Scaffolded with [CRA](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html), based on the course [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

Added some extra features like dynamic labels using [@react-aria/label](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-aria/label) and I use locaStorage for persisting date added unit tests.

## TODO

- Add more tests
- Add backend (FireBase?)
- Make year-filter dynamic
- Replace chart with [D3 React](https://github.com/react-d3-library/react-d3-library)
- Deploy (GitHub pages? Netlify? Vercel?)
